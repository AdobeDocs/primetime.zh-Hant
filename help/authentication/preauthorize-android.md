# 預先授權 {#preuthorize-android}

>[!NOTE]

應用程式需要使用預先授權API方法，才能取得一或多個資源的預先授權決定。 預先授權API請求應該用於UI提示和/或內容篩選。 在授與使用者對指定資源的存取權之前，必須先提出實際的授權API要求。



萬一發生意外錯誤（例如網路問題、無法使用MVPD授權端點等）， 當Adobe Primetime Authentication Services處理預先授權API要求時，受影響資源的一或多個分隔的錯誤資訊將會包含在預先授權API回應結果中。


## `public void preauthorize(PreauthorizeRequest request, AccessEnablerCallback<PreauthorizeResponse> callback);`


**說明：** 

**可用性：** v3.6.0+

**引數：**

- *PreauthorizeRequest*：用於定義請求的產生器物件
- AccessEnablerCallback ：用於傳回API回呼的回呼
- PreauthorizeResponse ：用來傳回API回應內容的物件


### 公用類別PreauthorizeRequest {#androidpreauthorizerequest}

**類別PreauthorizeRequest.Builder**\
 

```java
    ///
    /// Sets the `List` of resources for which you want to obtain preauthorization decisions.
    ///
    /// Each element in the list must be a `String` representing either the resource ID value or the media RSS fragment which must be agreed with the MVPD.
    ///
    /// This function sets the information only in the context of current `Builder` object instance which is the receiver of this function call.
    ///
    /// To build an actual `PreauthorizeRequest` you can have a look at `Builder`'s function:
    /// ```
    /// public func build() -> PreauthorizeRequest
    /// ```
    ///
    /// - Parameter resources: The `List` of resources for which you want to obtain preauthorization decisions.
    ///
    /// - Returns: The reference to the same `Builder` object instance which is the receiver of the function call. It does this in order to allow the creation of function chaining.
    ///

    /// This function uses the values set in advance in the context of current `Builder` object instance which is the receiver of this function call.
    ///
    /// Bear in mind that this function does not produce any side effects, therefore it does not alter the state of the SDK or the state of the `Builder` object instance which is the receiver of this function call.
    ///
    /// It means that successive calls of this function for the same receiver will create different new `PreauthorizeRequest` object instances, but having the same information, in case the values set to the `Builder` where not modified between the calls.
    ///
    /// In case you do not need to update any of the provided information (resources, features, etc.) you may reuse the `PreauthorizeRequest` instance for multiple uses of the `preauthorize` API.
