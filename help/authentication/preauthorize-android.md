# 預先授權 {#preuthorize-android}

>[!NOTE]
>
>此頁面的內容僅供參考。 若要使用此API，必須具備目前的Adobe授權。 不允許未經授權使用。

</br>


應用程式需要使用預授權API方法，以便獲得一個或多個資源的預授權決策。 應將預先授權API要求用於UI提示和/或內容篩選。 必須先提出實際的授權API要求，才能授予使用者對指定資源的存取權。



萬一發生非預期的錯誤（例如網路問題、MVPD授權端點無法使用等） 當Adobe Primetime驗證服務處理預先授權API請求時，會為受影響的資源納入一或多個個別的錯誤資訊，作為預先授權API回應結果的一部分。


## `public void preauthorize(PreauthorizeRequest request, AccessEnablerCallback<PreauthorizeResponse> callback);`


**說明：** 

**可用性：** v3.6.0+

**參數：**

- *PreauthorizeRequest*:用來定義請求的產生器物件
- AccessEnablerCallback :用來傳回API回應的回呼
- PreauthorizeResponse :用於傳回API回應內容的物件

**類別PreauthorizeRequest.Builder**\
 

```java
    ///
    /// Sets the `List` of resources for which you want to obtain preauthorization decisions.
    ///
    /// Each element in the list must be a `String` representing either the resource ID value or the media RSS fragment which must be agreed with the MVPD.
    ///
    /// This function sets the information only in the context of current `Builder` object instance which is the receiver of this function call.
    ///
    /// To build an actual `PreauthorizeRequest` you can have a look at `Builder`'s function:
    /// ```
    /// public func build() -> PreauthorizeRequest
    /// ```
    ///
    /// - Parameter resources: The `List` of resources for which you want to obtain preauthorization decisions.
    ///
    /// - Returns: The reference to the same `Builder` object instance which is the receiver of the function call. It does this in order to allow the creation of function chaining.
    ///

**public Builder setResources(List\&lt;string> 資源)**

    /// Sets the features which you want to have them disabled when obtaining preauthorization decisions.

    /// This function uses the values set in advance in the context of current `Builder` object instance which is the receiver of this function call.
    ///
    /// Bear in mind that this function does not produce any side effects, therefore it does not alter the state of the SDK or the state of the `Builder` object instance which is the receiver of this function call.
    ///
    /// It means that successive calls of this function for the same receiver will create different new `PreauthorizeRequest` object instances, but having the same information, in case the values set to the `Builder` where not modified between the calls.
    ///
    /// In case you do not need to update any of the provided information (resources, features, etc.) you may reuse the `PreauthorizeRequest` instance for multiple uses of the `preauthorize` API.
