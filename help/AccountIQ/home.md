# 帳戶IQ概述 {#account-iq-overview}

流媒體服務訂閱者共用證書是業界一個主要且日益嚴重的問題。 要增加此功能，瞭解、識別和處理憑據共用是一個複雜的過程。 瞭解用戶使用行為和開發其活動的整體視圖涉及複雜性，例如區分同一家庭內和外部成員之間的共用。 由於這一挑戰，流服務提供商在反對憑據共用方面可能存在障礙。


<div class "preview">
一般而言，視頻流服務提供商瞭解共用給其業務的風險和成本，但有有限的補救措施，例如阻止共用者或提供報價。 但是，建議採用一種有根據、有針對性的方法 — 一種使服務能夠準確理解共用，並採用獎勵良好觀看行為和同時瞄準業務增長的策略。 </span>

Adobe Primetime帳戶IQ使視頻流服務能夠理解用戶使用模式並識別憑據共用。 通過使用Adobe專有的多層機器學習模型對每個用戶留下的資料的長期記錄進行深入分析，流服務能夠更加準確地理解使用行為和識別憑證共用。 此外，它還允許通過與其他系統的整合來執行操作，並驗證了這些操作的影響 — 無論是鼓勵合法查看行為還是鼓勵不斷增長的訂閱者和收入。

Account IQ提供了衡量、管理和貨幣化憑據共用的工具和功能。 報告、分析和控制板使資料能夠進行探索以識別模式。 通過出口和與Adobe和第三方系統（如活動管理、貨幣限制或訂戶註冊）的整合，支援直接行動。 而專用的跟蹤工具可以衡量這些動作的成功，以便更新或擴展這些動作。

<!-- Credential sharing is rampant and prevalent among subscribers in the video streaming industry. To add to it, understanding, identifying, and acting on password sharing is a complex process. There is complexity involved in understanding the subscriber usage behavior and developing a holistic view of viewer activity—for example, distinguishing sharing among members within the same household and outside. Due to this challenge, streaming service providers have inhibitions in acting against password sharing.

Generally, video streaming service providers consider password sharing as fatal for business and act strongly against it, by blocking the sharers. However, it is advised to follow a holistic approach that enables them to understand sharing accurately and adopt strategies to reward good viewing behavior and target business growth simultaneously.

Adobe Primetime Account IQ enables video streaming services understand the subscriber usage patterns and identify password sharing by analyzing usage behavior. Moreover, it validates the impact of applying actions to encourage legitimate viewing behavior while maximizing business ROI, eventually growing subscribers and revenue.

By deeply analyzing the long, winding trail of data left behind by each subscriber using Adobe's proprietary multi-layer machine learning model, customers can understand usage behavior and identify password sharing with a greater degree of certainty, use the insights to validate the impact of applying actions to encourage legitimate viewing behavior while maximizing business growth, eventually act on password sharing using validated tactics to improve viewer experience, growing subscribers and revenue (for e.g. converting sharers to paid subscribers, managing ad loads based on sharing behavior, rewarding good behavior with better viewer experience).

Account IQ is helps you understand usage patterns and identify password sharing by leveraging the Primetime Authentication  solution that processes a huge volume of TV Everywhere transactions. A proprietary multi-layer machine learning model trained by this real-world TVE data accurately characterizes usage patterns and helps video streaming services understand usage patterns and identify password sharing at an individual account level. Based on Adobe's customer experience management solutions, Account IQ enables video streaming services to effectively use their audience data to create actionable sharing profiles as well powers integrations with other Adobe Digital Experience and 3rd party solutions—for example, Adobe Primetime Concurrency Monitoring or Adobe Analytics—to enable understanding usage patterns, identify and act upon password sharing.


<!-- The widespread availability of video content and streaming services bring with it problem of account sharing; eventually leading to the loss of revenue by content providers. Account IQ helps TV Everywhere and VOD (video on demand) providers understand the risks to their revenue and business operations, and determine the most effective actions to take to mitigate the impacts of credential fraud. It helps these media companies (MVPDs, Programmers, and VOD providers) manage and uncover the instances of password sharing with a high level of confidence, enabling them deliver better business outcomes and provide better viewing experiences for subscribers.

To help media companies better understand the password sharing within their businesses, Primetime Account IQ determines **Password Sharing Risk Index** that rates every subscriber on their likelihood of sharing account credentials for subscription passwords, from very low to very high. Based on these calculations and the resulting indices, analytics are performed and visuals are generated for better understanding and interpretation of the account sharing behavior. Account IQ is a hosted web application, which you can access using your browser.

Account IQ assigns sharing scores to different subscriber accounts, so that the content providers (media companies, programmers, MVPDs, and VOD providers) can take informed decisions about subscriber accounts and check the illicit sharing.

Passwords are the main methods for viewers to authenticate, and there is a misconception that credential sharing is allowed. This idea makes illicit password sharing a common practice; necessitating the need for media companies to educate their viewers about permissible sharing and prevent illicit sharing.-->
